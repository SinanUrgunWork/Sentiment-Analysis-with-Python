# Sentiment-Analysis-with-Python
This repository contains code for performing sentiment analysis on text data using two different approaches: VADER, a rule-based sentiment analysis tool developed by the Natural Language Processing group at the University of Pittsburgh, and Roberta, a pretrained language model developed by the Cardiff NLP group.

The code is implemented in Python, using various libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, and transformers. It includes a Jupyter notebook that walks through the steps for loading and preprocessing a dataset of reviews from Amazon, computing sentiment scores with VADER and Roberta, and comparing their performance. The results are visualized using bar plots, scatter plots, and pair plots, highlighting the distribution of sentiment scores across different review stars and the correlation between VADER and Roberta scores.

The notebook is designed to be easily reproducible, and can be run on any dataset of text data for sentiment analysis purposes. The required packages can be installed using pip or conda, and the pretrained model can be changed to other models in the Hugging Face library.

Feel free to use this code as a starting point for your own sentiment analysis projects, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions for improvement!
